# Contributing Guidelines

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

# How to Contribute

With these steps you can make a contribution:

1. Fork this repository, develop and test your changes on that fork
2. Commit changes
3. Submit a [pull request](#pull-requests) from your fork to this project.

Before starting, go through the requirements below.

## Commits

Please have meaningful commit messages.

### Commit Signature Verification

Each commit's signature must be verified.

- [About commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/about-commit-signature-verification)

### Sign off Your Work

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Here is the full text of the [DCO](./DCO). Contributors must sign-off each commit by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages.

This is my commit message

```
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
See git help commit:

-s, --signoff
    Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log
    message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically
    certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same
    license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see
    http://developercertificate.org/ for more information).
```

# Pull Requests

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests. See the above stated requirements for PR on this project.

Your Pull Request has to fulfill the following points, to be considered:

- Workflows must pass.
- DCO Check must pass.
- All commits correspond to the requirements (See [Commits](#commits))

## Work in Progress

By adding `WIP: *` as prefix for your pull request title, your pull request is considered not yet ready for review. This changes when removing this prefix later.

## Review

When creating a Pull Request is automatically assigned. If your Pull Request does not have any activity after certain days, feel free to comment a reminder (it might happen that we forget about it, since we maintain this repository part time). Your Pull Request requires approve to be mergeable.
